					<h1 className="text-2xl">What is ESG?</h1>
					<p>ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. ESG examines a companyâ€™s behavior and performance on a wide range of environmental, social, and governance criteria to identify its impact on our world and its material risks. There is no definitive set of ESG metrics and no standardized approach to the calculation of ESG metrics.  However, one thing is clear. ESG factors have become increasingly important in identifying investment opportunities. ESG gives investors a fuller understanding of the companies - . they help investors measure the ethical impact of an investment in a company; they also help investors understand the material risks and growth opportunities of a company.</p>
