# ESG Compare

## Our Purpose 
This website was created to provide the ESG ratings information of some of the largest publicly traded companies.  It reflects the ESG ratings of 620 public companies listed on either the NYSE or Nasdaq, most of which are included in the S&P 500.

The mission of this website is to: 
1. Raise awareness of the importance of sustainability
2. Facilitate socially responsible investing
3. Incentivize companies to create value for our society through responsible and ethical business practices.


## Tips for Users
* For a company’s own description of its ESG practices, click on the company SEC filings and select the company’s most recent proxy statement for its annual meeting where you will find disclosures about the company’s governance matters.
* Additionally, click on the company’s own website and navigate to its investor relations page where many big public companies publish their own sustainability reports.
* If you want to contact a company’s board of directors with concerns about the company’s ESG performance, you can find the contact information for the company’s board of directors on its investor relations pages (often under the Board Leadership page) or in its proxy statement.
